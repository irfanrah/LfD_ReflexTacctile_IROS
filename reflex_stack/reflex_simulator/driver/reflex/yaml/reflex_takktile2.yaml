#default_motor_speed: 
    # Default speed the motors travel at when given a position command.
#max_motor_speed: 
    # When commanded to a higher speed than this, the code will clamp the command 
    # down to this max speed. The motors can't physically travel much faster than this.
#max_motor_travel: 
    # Maximum position in radians that the motors can be commanded to.
#overload_threshold: 
    # Motor load at which the hand interrupts a command and loosens. 
    # If you need the hand to grip harder this can be adjusted, but be careful not 
    # to overheat the motor or physically damage the fingers when the motors grip with more force.
