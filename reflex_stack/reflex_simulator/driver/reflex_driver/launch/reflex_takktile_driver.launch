    <!-- default_contact_threshold: 
	This threshold value means that if the sensed tactile changes by more than 20 from where it was zeroed, that sensor will report that it is in contact. If the user lowers the threshold, perhaps to 10 or 7, it will take much less pressure to cause the hand to report contact. If the user wants to grip something firmly, they could raise the threshold value to make it take more force before reporting contact.
