# LfD Reflex Tactile Project

## Overview
This repository is a reproduction of the algorithm described in the paper "Robotic handling of compliant food objects by robust learning from demonstration" by Misimi, E., Olofsson, A., Eilertsen, A., Øye, E. R., & Mathiassen, J. R. (2018). We aim to simulate this algorithm in the Gazebo environment and provide resources and examples for the Learning from Demonstration (LfD) Reflex Tactile project.

## Paper Reference
For detailed information about the original research and methodologies, refer to the paper:
